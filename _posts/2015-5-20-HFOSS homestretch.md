title: HFOSS Homestretch Hackathon
---

The Homestretch Hackathon was a 'hackathon' put on by the HFOSS community at RIT. Unlike most hackathons, this one had no premise except "Finish your final projects before they are due!"

They had free pizza and music, so it was just a small gathering of about 30 students trying to finish everything up before the semester ends. I've never really attended a hackathon before, so I'm not quite sure if this completely qualifies as one. It was a nice chance to hang out with people who either were facing the same problems as me or knew how to fix them though. They were almost all either people from my HFOSS class or those who attended it before.

I spent most of my time with another team member for the [OLPC project](http://fad4470.github.io/XOTeamProp/) we were working on, trying to get things finalized. I wonder if most hackathons are like this, because if they are I really need to go to more of them.
