Personal answers:

Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why or why not?

Not entirely. I would rather there be a solid amount of readable, accessible documentation going in. People, while able to answer any question, are not always available and may not have the answer you are looking for or even have the wrong answer. Though the social structure of no established leaders is rather appealing.
