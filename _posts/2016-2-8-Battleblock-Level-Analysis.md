title: Battleblock Theater Analysis
---

I'm currently in a course which analyzes level design in video games. For our first few weeks, we were told to pick a level in a game and pry it apart.

I chose Battleblock Theater by [The Behemoth](https://www.thebehemoth.com/). They are a company well known for outstanding quality games and I have always admired their work. For the level, I chose the first one from a solo playlist they produced on the steam community workshop to promote the game's integration with the workshop. You can find the playlist [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243364210).
