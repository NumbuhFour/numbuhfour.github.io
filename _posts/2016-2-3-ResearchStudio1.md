title: Research Studio - Week 1
---

This semester I am taking an odd course since it amounts to basically working for the studio that is inside RIT.

So far it's been amazing. In one week I've learned a great deal in git and node and have already become accustomed to a project management tool called JIRA. Last semester I took a course called Production Studio, which was more like a directed group project class. The class would split into teams of 3-6, come up with an idea for a game, and build it from start to as close to a finished product as you could. I've talked about it [here](##), but what's different between that class and this one is that this Research Studio is just that, a studio. There is a CEO (the professor), project lead, team leads, and the teams all focused on making one product. We meet at least 5 times a week, often more, and present our progress every Wednesday. Overall, in comparison to past group projects, this one is a lot more like a job in its rigid structure.
And I'm really quite loving it.

JIRA:
  weekly sprints full of tasks
  tasks marked as in pending, in progress, or done (can be set by git commit messages)
GIT:
  branch for every JIRA task, named with task number prefixed
  push and pull-request all changes into development for minimum 3-person review including lead
  rebase upstream changes rather than merge
  clean and squash git history at every step
  Make sure automatic checks are happy (eg LINT)
Lots of git
  rebasing
  proper workflow
Linter
JIRA
Team and meetings
