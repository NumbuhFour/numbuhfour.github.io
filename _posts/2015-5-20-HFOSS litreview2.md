title: HFOSS&#58; Lit Review 2
---
This is a literature review of [A Legal Issues Primer for Open Source and Free Software Projects](https://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/foss-primer.pdf)

It serves as an introduction to the many different kinds of copyright licenses, as well as their categories. 

The Good:
It gives a good overview of all the different licenses an open-source project may need, and where they would best be applied. Most of the descriptions are pretty short, and link similarities and differences between each other. It could almost be used as a reference guide each time someone needs to pick a license. It also does a pretty good job of keeping the vocabulary of these descriptions within the scope of an everyday person, so you don't already have to be a lawyer to read this.

The Bad:
Several of the chapters past the initial descriptions of the licenses don't clearly describe why they are relevant to open-source project licenses. Plus, they are in full-on lawyer-speak, and I can barely parse out enough to get a gist of what it is saying through most of the text.

Questions:
 - How often do these licenses 'break'? Or in other words, are there people trying to nullify these licenses, or are they sound?
 - Who would be trying to break them if they are? and why?
