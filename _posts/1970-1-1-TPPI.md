title: Test Post; Please Ignore  (:) &#58; colon?
---

This is a post dedicated to testing Jekyll capabilities with Github Pages since until I setup Jekyll locally, I cannot perform tests without pushing to the master branch

Test1: Html code for colons in title? Since a normal colon breaks Jekyll

Test2: Tables in markdown

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

| Title | Title2 |

| Rawr | ASNVAK |
| Stuff | is |
| here | maybe |
