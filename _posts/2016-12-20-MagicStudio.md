title: Working in the Magic Spells Studio

For my last two semesters at RIT, I've taken a course led by Andy Phelps that emulates what it is like to work in a small game production studio. And it was fantastic.

### Overview

[Andy Phelps](http://igm.rit.edu/~andy/), founder of RIT's School of Interactive Games and Media as well as the founder and director of RIT's Center for Media, Arts, Games, Interaction, and Creativity, set up this course about 2 years ago. It's purpose was to bring in students who wanted to see what it is like to put in the work for a true studio, not just some project for a class. Everyone in the class works together on one project and it is graded as a whole based on how far along it is expected to be at the end of the semester. This last semester was the fourth time this course was offered and they just released an earlier game they created on Steam and Xbox titled [Hack, Slash & Backstab](http://hackslashbackstab.rit.edu/).

In essence, you are expected to put in roughly the same amount of work for this class as you would if it are a job (subtracting time required to pass other classes) because you are, in essence, an employee. You sign an NDA at the beginning, get assigned to your role, and do everything asked and more to make sure the project set forth by the CEO (Andy) is completed.  
The cool thing is that it is almost entirely student run. Andy and his parter Aaron Cloutier serve as the CEO and Creative Director respectively. It is their job to come up with the inital project idea and give feedback on progress at milestones. The rest is students. Andy hires one student beforehand as a co-op to be the Production Manager who wrangles in the rest of the class. From there the team is split up into groups based on the category of work needed from them each with their own team lead.  

My first semester I worked on a project called [DelVR](http://delvr.magic.rit.edu/landing) which was a web-application where you could create a map for a roleplaying game like a dungeon or something then walk around and view it in VR using google cardboard. My second project was a sidescrolling arcade shooter game called Fragile Equilibrium with some unusual playstyle-shifting mechanics.
