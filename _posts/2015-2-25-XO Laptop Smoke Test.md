title: XO Laptop Smoke Test

So for my HFOSS course, we were given XO laptops. I’m not sure why yet, but it sure is cool.

The first assignment is to perform a [smoke test](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Smoke_test/10.1.x/1_hour_smoke_test) to check all the features for bugs or breaks. After going through what I could, all the hardware seems functional. Without another XO to communicate with some tests are impossible, but I have no reason to believe its broken. Can’t wait to see what we do with this thing. I don’t have a laptop myself since the Macbook Air my uncle gave has made a full conversion into nothing more than an aluminum frisbee, so I can probably find some uses for it myself.
