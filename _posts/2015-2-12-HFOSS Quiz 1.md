This is a post answering questions for a class I’m taking. Not much more to say besides that.

In Chapter 3 of Stephen Weber’s The Success of Open Source, there was a listing of eight “General Principles” contained within the chapter. Last week, we discussed in class the five pillars of “The Open Source Way.”

1.	*What are the titles of each Pillar?*
	+	Open Exchange
	+	Participation
	+	Rapid Prototyping
	+	Meritocracy
	+	Community
	
2.	*What are the titles of each General Principle?*
	+	Make it Interesting and Make Sure it Happens
	+	Scratch an Itch
	+	Minimize How Many Times You Have to Reinvent the Wheel
	+	Solve Problems Through Parallel Work Processes Whenever Possible
	+	Leverage the Law of Large Numbers
	+	Document What You Do
	+	Release Early and Release Often
	+	Talk a Lot
	
3.	*What are the similarities between Weber’s eight principles, and the five pillars?*
	They both believe that the key to open source is making things open and accessible to anyone who wants to contribute.

4.	*What are the differences?*
	Weber’s principals are more focused on the people who contribute to open-source works and what they need to consider, while the principles are more of a definition of what an open-source project is.
5.	*Who’s “keen analysis” did Weber “Draw Heavily” upon?”*
	Eric S. Raymond
6.	*What was the title of this “keen analysis?”*
	The Cathedral and the Bazaar
7.	*Where can this keen analysis be found?*
