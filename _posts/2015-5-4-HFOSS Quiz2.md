### In the first 3 Chapters of the SFLC's FOSS Legal Primer, there was much background information on the types of licenses a FOSS Developer may choose, and why.
 
 - When does a work become "copyrighted" by an Author?
 
 As soon as the idea comes out of the mind and onto a tangible medium. (physical and digital included)

 - Without copyright, there could be no copyleft. What are the copyrights that an author has when they create a work, according to the US Copyright office?

 Right to sell, reproduce, edit, distribute, and pass permission of any of these things to others.
 
 - Free/Open Source Licenses fall onto a spectrum of Software Freedom. What descriptive words are at either end?
 restrictive & distributive vs permissive & non-copyleft
 
 
 - When someone reliquishes their copyrights, this is referred to as what?
 Waiver
 
 - Below is a list of licenses. Please identify where on the spectrum each falls, and whether or not it is an OSI approved license.
