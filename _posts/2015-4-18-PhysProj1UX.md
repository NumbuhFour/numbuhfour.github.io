title: PhysComp&#58; Project1 Experience Taxonomy

category: blog

This is a writeup for my [Physical Media Project 1]( {{ site.baseurl }}/Physical%20Computing%20Project1/) describing the taxonomies of the experience I intended to create. 
Since it was such a small project, this writeup will be equally small as there were not a lot of intended emotions beyond curiosity.

### Approaching 
---
Slight curiosity. They would see two white LEDs and a few components.

### During
---
Interest, puzzlement. Coming close would prompt the device to change its colors to green. As the user experiments, they'd find that waving a hand changes the color to yellow and touching it would turn it red irreversibly. 
Leaving and coming back only makes it change to white as they are at a distance. It's not until I explain that they have made the device upset and must apologize through the use my phone's bluetooth connection does the device turn green and yellow again.

### After
---
Satisfaction of the slight curiosity. It is a small device with small features to be discovered.
