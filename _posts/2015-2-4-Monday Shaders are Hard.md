title: Monday&#58; Shaders are Hard
category: blog
---

The AI game I mentioned last week has quickly become more of an exercise in graphics rather than AI. While hung-up on not having any idea what to do to make Unity’s built-in navigation system simulate queuing, I’ve instead turned to messing with shaders, with which I have almost no experience. The concept of the game involves selecting an NPC on-screen with the mouse, so I’m trying to do some silly shader shenanigans with a second overlay camera to highlight whoever is selected. So far, it’s proven difficult.
1:00am Edit: Nevermind, this funk rocks socks.
