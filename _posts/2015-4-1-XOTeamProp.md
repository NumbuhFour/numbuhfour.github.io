### List Your Other Team Members  Below:

	- [direkitteh](http://direkitteh.tumblr.com/post/114182650154/team-proposal-education) : lkd8070@rit.education
	- milistisia2 : bxc4440@rit.edu
	- NumbuhFour : fad4470@rit.edu
	- holtr94 : rgh7614@rit.edu

### Which Project Did Your Team Choose?

	Mini Game Mayhem

### 2-liner description of the project?

	An application similar to Luminosity with a collection of math-themed games to teach various topics of the fourth grade curriculum. Users receive scores for their performance and can improve over time.

### What will each team member’s role be?

	Everyone will make their own very small minigames and assist in others where needed.

### Source Code Repository URL?

	- Github: https://github.com/milistisia2/MiniGameMayhem

	- Sugar labs build: https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-build

	- Sugarizer: https://github.com/llaske/Sugarizer

### List your upstream Mentors below:

	To be determined

### How will you communicate with them? (i.e. IRC Channel, Email Addresss, mail lists, issue trackers, etc…)

	- IRC channel (irc://irc.freenode.net#sugar)
	- Email sugar-devel mail list (sugar-devel@lists.sugarlabs.org)

### What are the easy parts?

	- Adjusting to sugar lab development environment
	- Getting in contact with sugar lab developers
	- Testing

### What are the hard parts?

	- Creating multiple small, fun games that teach concepts
	- Having enough functional content
	- Getting everything done in six weeks
	- Avoiding adding too many features that will make it too much work to complete, while still keeping it interesting
	- Masking the lessons under themes rather than math

### How will you overcome both?

	- Staying in constant contact with other team members
	- Coming up with ideas early
	- Building prototypes early
	- Keeping the scope as small as possible
