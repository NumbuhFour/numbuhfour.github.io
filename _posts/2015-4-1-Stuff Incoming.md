title: Stuff Incoming!

After not having access to my wordpress blog for about 2 weeks due to both my forgetfullness and stubornness, a lot of things have built up. Many projects have picked those particular weeks to show their faces so hopefully I can talk about some of those things.

Also, there will probably be at least one test-post and many temporary errors. The down side of using Github Pages (until I setup Jekyll locally) is that I can't test things without committing and pushing. The worse thing is that pages are only visible on the master branch, and I am well aware that testing on the master branch is blasphemy at best... Maybe rebasing could be a solution? But I don't know enough about that subject yet to know.
