The center Marvin was subjected to an acetone vapor bath for about 10 minutes. The large gashes on its back were an unintentional error during printing, but was chosen to see how acetone affected such deep dents in plastic.

The last picture is of a set of puzzle pieces designed to fit together. The one on the right was subjected to acetone via a paintbrush. It didn't work great, though I might have had better results if I kept at it. Unfortunately, I believe the acetone dissolved the glue holding the paintbrush bristles together, because a lot of them got stuck into the melting plastic, ruining the brush and leaving hairs permanently embedded into the piece.
