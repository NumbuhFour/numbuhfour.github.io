A short project to explore the potential of the Raspberry Pi, as well as a means of learning more about unix in general.

It is intended to be a SSH-Ready computer that you plug into another with just one cable, and at a flick of a switch reveals its storage. This made developing on the two-port Raspberry Pi Zero much easier and gave me a personal computer I could carry around in my pocket.
