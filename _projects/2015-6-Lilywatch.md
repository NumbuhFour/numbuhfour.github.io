The Lilywatch is a multi-function watch capable of communicating with your android device. It began as a final class project and I talk more about it [in my blog posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/posts/LilywatchP1) about it. By the end, its major features were bluetooth-connectivity, phone-triggered events (text message, missed call, etc), and IR communication with my [RPiTV](/projects/posts/RaspPiTV).
