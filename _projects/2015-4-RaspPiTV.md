Walking past my TV every morning inspired me to do something with it. Leaving it off and unused felt like such a waste, so I put together a small webpage just to display some basic information. Namely the time, weather, and some interesting news articles.

I also built a small circuit for it with a PIR sensor so that it would go black if it doesn't detect anyone in the room for long periods of time. It was a nice thing to see greet me whenever I walked to that side of the apartment in the morning.

Later on, when I built the [Lilywatch]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/posts/LilywatchP1), I moved the webpage onto a spare computer tower I had while adding an IR receiver to detect codes sent from the watch. These were relayed onto an [edited version]({{ site.baseurl }}/experiments/StreamusExtension) of a chrome extension called Streamus which played music from youtube as though it were like iTunes or a similar music player.
