<h1 class='center'> - Experiments - </h1>
<p class="page_description">
  This is a large list of the things I've tinkered with or attempted to make in my spare time. Some were meant to be big projects that fizzled for whatever reason. Others are just small experiments to learn the nature of some tool or test an idea. They cover a wide variety of subjects since my favorite things to do are learning and making, I never shy away from trying a new topic despite how little experience I may have with it.
