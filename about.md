I am a fourth-year student currently studying Game Design and Development at the Rochester Institute of Technology!

I focus in general game programming as well as graphics programming, but experiment in just about any field or tool I can wrap my head around.
So far this has included:

  - Game Network Programming
  - 3D Modelling & Animation
  - 3D Printing
  - Web Development
  - Arduino tinkering
  - Replacing my existence with Raspberry PIs
  - Ceramics
  - Papercraft
  - this Jekyll site

...and probably more that I'm just forgetting.
