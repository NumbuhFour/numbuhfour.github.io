This is a Jekyll site hosted via Github Pages

Originally forked from [barryclark's Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) site generator.

I don't update this very often at all, but when I feel particularly inspired, I might dump some info on some projects I have tried or completed since the last update.
